# About me

I have been programming in python for over 7 years just working on hobby projects.


# Projects

### Currently working on my own compiled programming language named BCL.

If you are interested, star my project on github.

### Simple Serialize-to-Image

Take python data and represent it in the bytes of a 3-channel image file (rgb).
It also works the other way around. Very simple ~200 line module to be included in whatever
project you may way.

It was really a quick project I made while I was bored, but it has documentation
in the readme.md
